# moar-dots
A Python utility for managing dotfiles and system configuration files

## ideas
* dotfiles are processed by tags
* dot class to handle placement or removal of dotfiles as needed
* .local dotfiles which are added to the main dotfile thru a call
* tags processed by OS, hostname, and other metrics
* tags are processed in a hierarchical order (always processed in order)
* errors are handled through a function that says a funny comment
* errors are tracked in 50DKP-minuses which are displayed when the command is run
